For the most part of my life (which is not very long), death is rarely mentioned on a casual occasion. It’s a sensitive topic, a rude one perhaps. It is the beast, cuffed and caged, thrown into the basement of a castle where tales become myths and rumours. It’s the alligator in the sewer about whom people talk in the death of the night, when they feel the craving for horror, just to simply let the stories slide with “Why would I ever go to the sewer? Heh heh.” as an excuse for a dreamy night. It is the ghost haunting us in the most private place in our minds, suppressed and hidden behind walls and fences. Every waking moment we spend is to distract ourselves from the fact that the bony lips of Death himself might be half an inch away from our foreheads. It is a sensitive topic, even outside conversation.

I believe you have thought about your own death more than once. Scary, ain’t it? Perhaps it’s tomorrow, when a slip on the staircase breaks four parts of your neck, or it might be 70 years ahead, when you go into the forever silence, lonely in the darkness when all your acquaintances have already gone and no memory of you will remain. We fear death unlike how we fear thunder, or snake, or being rejected. We may be afraid of said things because they might hurt us, wound our flesh and mind, or because we don’t understand it enough. We fear death differently. We fear death because of what it is: death is death. The more we know about it the more menacing it becomes.

It turns life into dust, erases memories and makes consciousness nothingness. Others may die ‘easily’. Puff! And they’re gone, dead, non-alive and having no worry in the world. Under another perspective, every second closer to death, the dying me see another infinitive. The sheer thought of myself seeing each of the senses turning off, when time slows down, and stop moving at the last awake instance of my being, right before I become a senseless mushy pile of carbonic compounds. That thought is just frightening.

Death is inevitable. It’s standing at the end of the tunnel, spreading arms and ready to welcome us into the oblivion. When we lift our head and stare it into the eyes, everything becomes so much more meaningless than ever; and unexpectedly, the hidden gems begin to rise. It’s like when 5 minutes away from the end of playtime, you start to tell others what you actually wanted to play. Most of our waking time we spend is to distract the inevitable death – the ultimate deadline for whatever matters. It may sound absurd, but every time I think of death, I feel more alive than ever, to be awake, know, not know, be temporary and awfully prone to the “Puff! Then he’s gone forever.” Maybe in those times, I realise what I don’t want to think of on the brink of darkness. When I look Death into the eyes, deep inside the hollow sockets I see my life sprouts and wilts, the being that could be, can be, and the now, where the path splits and I get to choose.
